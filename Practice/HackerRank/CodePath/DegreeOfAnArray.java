/**
 * Given an array of integers, we define its degree as the number of occurrenses of the element
 * that occurs most frequently in the array. You will be given a list of integers and must determine
 * two properties
 * 1) the dgree of the array
 * 2) the length of the shortest sub-array that shares that degree
 * 
 * For example consider the array [1,2,1,3,2] it has a degree of 2 based on the elements with values
 * 1 and 2. The subarray of degree 2 based on the 1's is [1,,2,1] and based on the 2's is [2,1,3,2]
 * Their lengths are 3 and 4 so the shorest length 3. Property 1 is 2 and property 2 is 3
